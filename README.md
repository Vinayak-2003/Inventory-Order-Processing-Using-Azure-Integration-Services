# Order Processing and Inventory Management System

## Introduction 
This system is designed to manage the inventory and order processing efficiently using Azure services.
- Receiving and storing order details
- Communicating via azure service bus
- Inserting, updating and deleting inventory (manage and update) items using HTTP function

## Components
- Azure function app
- Azure Service bus
- Azure SQL database and Server

## Implementation Steps

- The Order Processing Function App receives an order.
- It stores the order details in Azure SQL Database.
- It sends a message to the Service Bus for inventory update.
